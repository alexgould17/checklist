# Checklist Project

## Description & Goals
I want the checklist program to be a program that allows me to record tasks & goals, see that which I have previously recorded & interact with to note completion. In addition, it should be able to organize those tasks & goals in both visually & logically pleasing ways. In doing this, it should help me stay focused on the tasks I need & want to accomplish while also keeping my motivation to continue up by indicating my progress & celebrating my completion. It should also bend to accommodate my varied needs & desires, including being phone-accessible. There should also be user login with passwords so that multiple ppl an use the app.
